# Z Score Chrome Extension

### Form Fashion

#### Provides 3 simple feature

1. find the proportion for a given standard score
2. find the upper and lower bounds of Z and corresponding proportion, for a given proportion value
3. a stupid-simple *calculator* if you want to do a quick addition or subtraction with the extension page

**Notes** The proportion means a probability that a statistic is less than Z (i.e. between negative infinity and Z).

This is what it looks like.
